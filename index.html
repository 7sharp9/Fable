</h2>

<p>Fable brings together the power of the <a href="http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Compiler.Service/">F# compiler</a>
and <a href="http://babeljs.io">Babel</a> to make JavaScript a true backend for F#.
Some of its main features are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Works directly on F# source code, no compilation to .NET bytecode needed</li>
<li>Optimizes F# code to generate as clean JavaScript as possible</li>
<li>Passes location data to Babel to generate source maps</li>
<li>Compatible with all Babel plugins and other JS development tools, like Webpack</li>
<li><a href="docs/compatibility.md">Support for most of the F# core library and a bit of .NET Base Class Library</a></li>
<li>Tiny core library included without runtime</li>
<li>Organizes code using ES6 modules </li>
<li>Interacts seamlessly with other JavaScript libraries</li>
<li>Bonus: <a href="docs/testing.md">compile NUnit tests to Mocha</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="philosophy" class="anchor" href="#philosophy" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Philosophy</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Clean code</strong>: The compiler must emit JavaScript as readable as possible
which plays well with other JS code and development tools, even if this
means sacrificing a bit F# semantics. </li>
<li>
<strong>Unopinionated</strong>: The project shouldn't compromise with a specific platform
and adapt to standard JavaScript in any environment: browser or node.</li>
<li>
<strong>Open to the community</strong>: If the project is to survive, it needs the support of the community. For that, maintainers should compromise to keep the project documented and make it easy for people to contribute. A plugin system is also planned.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="installing" class="anchor" href="#installing" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installing</h2>

<p>The project is still in testing phase and hasn't been packaged yet. If you wan to try it out,
make sure you have <a href="http://fsharp.org">F# 4.0 with .NET/Mono</a> and an updated version of <a href="https://nodejs.org">node.js</a> installed.
Download the repo and run:</p>

<pre><code>build.cmd Release   // on windows    
./build.sh Release  // on unix

npm install         // both platforms, installs node dependencies
</code></pre>

<p>If everything works, follow <a href="docs/compiling.md">these instructions</a> to compile a F# project or script file to JS.</p>

<h2>
<a id="contributing" class="anchor" href="#contributing" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Contributing</h2>

<p>At the moment, the best way to contribute is to battle-test the project, report issues,
create samples and help promoting it. Please focus on what is possible right now rather than
asking for many new features :)</p>

<p>Issues with the label <code>discussion</code> will be also added to ask the opinion of the community
on different topics like the logo, roadmap, etc.</p>

<p>Soon documents explaining the (quite simple) architecture of the compiler will be included,
making it easier to participate in the development of the compiler itself. A plugin system
is also planned to allow editing the intermediate AST in order to, for example, enable type providers. </p>

<h2>
<a id="caveats" class="anchor" href="#caveats" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Caveats</h2>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Options are erased</strong> in compiled code. This has several benefits like removing overhead
and interacting with native JS functions in a safer way (<code>null</code> will be <code>None</code>).
However, it will lead to unexpected results if you do weird things like wrapping <code>null</code> in <code>Some</code>.
For practical purposes, Fable considers <code>null</code>, <code>undefined</code>, <code>None</code> and <code>unit</code> to be the same thing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Information about generic types is not included</strong> in the generated JavaScript, so code that
depends on this information to be known at runtime for method dispatching may have unexpected behaviour.</p></li>
<li><p>At the moment, comparison for non-primitive values defaults to JS reference comparison so there's
<strong>no structural comparison</strong> for records, unions, tuples or collections. This may change in the future
upon users' feedback.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Map and Set</strong> default to the new ES6 Map and Set classes which must increase performance,
but with the downside that adding and removing operations are <strong>mutable</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Debugging the F# code is not perfect</strong>. For example, you may see the debugger jump directly
to the last expression in many functions. This is normal and due to the optimizations performed
on the generated code.</p></li>
</ul>

<a id="acknowledgements" class="anchor" href="#acknowledgements" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Acknowledgements</h2>

<p>Of course, this project wouldn't have been possible without the fantastic work of the <a href="http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Compiler.Service/">F# compiler</a>
and <a href="http://babeljs.io">Babel</a> teams. I hope they feel proud seeing how their work has met in
a very unexpected way, giving developers even more possibilities to build great apps.</p>

<p>The awesome F# community has played a big role in making this possible. I've met incredible
people and it's impossible to list all the names without forgetting anyone, but I'd like to
give a particular mention to <a href="https://github.com/ZachBray">Zach Bray</a> for his work on <a href="http://funscript.info/">FunScript</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dsyme">Don Syme</a> (the fact that the designer
of the language himself shows interest in your work, no matter how humble it is, is really a big push!)
and <a href="https://github.com/Krzysztof-Cieslak">Krzysztof Cie≈õlak</a> (I always have to look up the name to spell it correctly) because he's shown that
F# is a perfect fit for a <a href="http://ionide.io/">big project targeting JS</a>.</p>

<p>And finally I'd like to thank my partner (is it too old-fashioned to say wife?) for bearing with me
everyday.</p>
