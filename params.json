For that, maintainers should compromise to keep the project documented and make it easy for people to contribute. A plugin system is also planned.\r\n\r\n## Installing\r\n\r\nThe project is still in testing phase and hasn't been packaged yet. If you wan to try it out,\r\nmake sure you have [F# 4.0 with .NET/Mono](http://fsharp.org) and an updated version of [node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.\r\nDownload the repo and run:\r\n```\r\nbuild.cmd Release   // on windows    \r\n./build.sh Release  // on unix\r\n\r\nnpm install         // both platforms, installs node dependencies\r\n```\r\nIf everything works, follow [these instructions](docs/compiling.md) to compile a F# project or script file to JS.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nAt the moment, the best way to contribute is to battle-test the project, report issues,\r\ncreate samples and help promoting it. Please focus on what is possible right now rather than\r\nasking for many new features :)\r\n\r\nIssues with the label `discussion` will be also added to ask the opinion of the community\r\non different topics like the logo, roadmap, etc.\r\n\r\nSoon documents explaining the (quite simple) architecture of the compiler will be included,\r\nmaking it easier to participate in the development of the compiler itself. A plugin system\r\nis also planned to allow editing the intermediate AST in order to, for example, enable type providers. \r\n\r\n## Caveats\r\n\r\n- **Options are erased** in compiled code. This has several benefits like removing overhead\r\n  and interacting with native JS functions in a safer way (`null` will be `None`).\r\n  However, it will lead to unexpected results if you do weird things like wrapping `null` in `Some`.\r\n  For practical purposes, Fable considers `null`, `undefined`, `None` and `unit` to be the same thing.\r\n\r\n- **Information about generic types is not included** in the generated JavaScript, so code that\r\n  depends on this information to be known at runtime for method dispatching may have unexpected behaviour.\r\n\r\n- At the moment, comparison for non-primitive values defaults to JS reference comparison so there's\r\n  **no structural comparison** for records, unions, tuples or collections. This may change in the future\r\n  upon users' feedback.\r\n\r\n- **Map and Set** default to the new ES6 Map and Set classes which must increase performance,\r\n  but with the downside that adding and removing operations are **mutable**.\r\n\r\n- **Debugging the F# code is not perfect**. For example, you may see the debugger jump directly\r\n  to the last expression in many functions. This is normal and due to the optimizations performed\r\n  on the generated code.\r\n\r\nTo know more, read [Compatibility](docs/compatibility.md).\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nOf course, this project wouldn't have been possible without the fantastic work of the [F# compiler](http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Compiler.Service/)\r\nand [Babel](http://babeljs.io) teams. I hope they feel proud seeing how their work has met in\r\na very unexpected way, giving developers even more possibilities to build great apps.\r\n\r\nThe awesome F# community has played a big role in making this possible. I've met incredible\r\npeople and it's impossible to list all the names without forgetting anyone, but I'd like to\r\ngive a particular mention to [Zach Bray](https://github.com/ZachBray) for his work on [FunScript](http://funscript.info/), [Don Syme](https://github.com/dsyme) (the fact that the designer\r\nof the language himself shows interest in your work, no matter how humble it is, is really a big push!)\r\nand [Krzysztof Cie≈õlak](https://github.com/Krzysztof-Cieslak) (I always have to look up the name to spell it correctly) because he's shown that\r\nF# is a perfect fit for a [big project targeting JS](http://ionide.io/).\r\n\r\nAnd finally I'd like to thank my partner (is it too old-fashioned to say wife?) for bearing with me\r\neveryday.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
